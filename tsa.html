<h2> <center> <b> <u> The Technology Student Association's Creed: </u> </b> </center> </h2>
<blockquote> <h3> <center> "I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, 
  materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, 
  and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, 
  more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind,
  I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans." </blockquote> </h3> <br>

  <h3> <center> Our Technology Student Organization chapter meets once a week till the competition date where we work on our events 
    and collaborate with each other in a safe, nurturing, and knowledgeable environment. Our chapter officers are committed into proper
    organization and making sure everyone has fun while succeeding in their event. Students are also scheduled to work after school 
    if needed to work on their event. Over the course of the years our chapter has existed, our chapter has been growing constantly. It has also been home to state and national winners. 
 Though we are a relatively new and small chapter, each one of us are committed to strive for the best in each of our events and succeed in the technical world.  </center> </h3> <br>

  <h3><center><en> Community Service </en> </center></h3>
  <h3><center> The TSA Chapter at MOT has given back to the community in several ways. One of the most significant community service projects, 
    helped teach STEM to local elementary school students. Through elementary school mentoring, TSA students partnered up with children in less fortunate areas and taught them how to complete a science fair project.
    Finally, members went to different local communities to raise awareness about the helping hand project outlining that members are willing to help the young or the elderly when needed.
